// Most style variables we want to override will be in node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss
// To find out what variable you need to override, inspect element and find what bootstrap variable is causing undesired appearance.
// It may not show the exact name. For example, the link color was called "bs-link-color-rgb". Just try overriding some variables
// that seem like they will be close.

// Any CSS variable overrides will go here. Note these should only be applied if we want them to be the default for the entire website.
